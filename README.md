# Deriv

## Brief

Deriv is full graphical and cross-platform client for the Wired 2.0 protocol. It is built against [libwired](https://github.com/nark/libwired) and [Qt](http://qt-project.org) frameworks and aims to fill the gap on Linux and Windows platforms. OSX already benefits of a full software suite and this project should facilitate the use of Wired 2.0 on other platforms. 

The project is under development and *no packaged application is available yet*. It currently compiles fine on OSX 10.9 using Qt 5.2.1. It currently only provides a very basic chat and multi-connections abilities.

NB: If you are an experienced C/C++ developer interested in contributing to this project, do not hesitate to contact me and/or to submit pull-requests. Have a look to issues page for more details about the road map. Everyone is also welcome if interested in helping to the cross-plateform deployement effort (Windows and Linux).
